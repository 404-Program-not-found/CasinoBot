# CasinoBot
An economy discord bot focused on gambling. Built both for toying around with the discord API and to learn python


### Instructions
---
I would prefer it if you didn't run an instance of my very crude bot, but I cannot stop you.

1. Install the latest version of Discord.py
```
$ pip install discord.py
```
2. Define token as enviroment variable
Windows:
```
$ set casinotoken = <Token>
```
$ Linux/Unix/MacOS:
```
$ export casinotoken = <Token>
```
3. Run bot in enviroment
```
$ python3 CasinoBot.py
```
